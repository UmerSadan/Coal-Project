Mario Game – x86 Assembly

“Ahhh… just lines of code coming together to create a full Mario world!”

A custom Mario-style platformer created entirely in x86 Assembly, using Irvine32 and WinAPI to handle graphics, input, and system-level operations.
This project demonstrates how low-level programming can drive a complete game with movement, enemies, power-ups, and hidden areas—all coded with precise control over memory and logic.

🎮 Key Features

Smooth player movement: left, right, and jump

Hidden bonus room filled with extra coins

Enemy freezing ability
